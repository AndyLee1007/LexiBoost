- **Smart Spaced Repetition**: Words are reviewed at optimal intervals (0dâ†’1dâ†’3dâ†’7dâ†’14d)
- **Wrongbook System**: Incorrect words are automatically added to a review queue
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily and total score tracking
- **CSV Import**: Import custom word lists via CSV files
- **Kid-Friendly Interface**: Simple, colorful, and engaging design
- **Self-Testing**: Built-in system diagnostics

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash

## How It Works

### Question Generation
- The app generates safe, age-appropriate sentences (6-16 words)
- Target words are highlighted in the sentence
- Each question has 1 correct answer and 2 distractors

### Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- **Correct Answer**: Word moves to next SRS interval
- **Incorrect Answer**: Word returns to beginning of cycle
- **Graduation**: Words are removed from wrongbook after 3 correct answers

### Scoring System
- **+1 point** for each correct answer
- **Daily scores** and **total scores** are tracked
- **Accuracy statistics** shown at session completion
